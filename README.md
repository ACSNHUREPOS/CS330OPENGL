* How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I usually start by analyzing the project's main goal and creating a schematic or pseudocode. As a result of the project, I learned a lot, mostly about 3D graphics. Before, I had yet to ever program resources, and I had been trying out 3D art programs like Adobe. It was my first time coding 3D assets or using OpenGL. I followed the modules and created each step of the scene, rendered it, then adjusted the camera, feel, and lighting. I break them down whenever I develop programs and work on them simultaneously. The iteration factor helped me understand some concepts, even though they took me some time to grasp. Instead of writing my code, I coded my 3D scene with existing libraries and formulas.
I was also progressing because I broke it down into smaller pieces. To advance my career as a mobile and web developer, I have to know a lot about computer science. It would take me a lot more time to gain proficiency in this area if I spent more time learning these skills and concepts. I would appreciate graphics and game engines developed by engineers more in terms of computational graphics and visualizations. As a result of working with existing libraries, formulas, and code, I have gained expertise in computational graphics and visualization. I also have a better understanding of color, space, and graphics.
